After many years of inactivity (the last entry on [eikke.com](http://eikke.com)
was written in 2010...) I decided to pick up blogging again. Nothing here yet,
expect more content soon!

For the curious: the picture above comes from **The C Programming Language,
First Edition** by Kernighan & Ritchie, published in 1978
([archive.org](https://archive.org) maintains a
[copy](https://archive.org/details/TheCProgrammingLanguageFirstEdition), page
6). Using "Hello, world" as a textbook example for programming languages goes
way back.
