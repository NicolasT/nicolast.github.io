title: "A Git Branching Model for Releases with Generated Files"
excerpt: >
    Version Control Systems and generated files don't play nice together,
    though for some projects such files need to be included in release
    packages. This article introduces a release and branching scheme to
    get the best of both worlds.

Common wisdom dictates not to track generated files under source-control, which
is good practice: they clutter diffs and pull-requests, one needs to ensure
they're always updated whenever changes are made,... Some platforms or
build-systems require generated files to be part of distributed packages though,
and keeping record of what gets delivered to users is of utmost importance. I
recently adopted a release/branching scheme to bridge this gap.

Platforms which require machine-generated files to be part of release packages
include the JavaScript ecosystem, where often packed and/or minified versions
of a set of source files (generated by tools like [Gulp] or [Webpack]) are
bundled in a distribution, or build systems like the [Autotools] toolchain
(which brings us the familiar `./configure`, `make`, `make install` procedure)
where files like `configure` and `Makefile.in` are generated from
`configure.ac` and `Makefile.am` (and other auxiliary files).

[Gulp]: http://gulpjs.com
[Webpack]: https://webpack.js.org
[Autotools]: https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html

The traditional approach to generate release (source) packages for such projects
is to generate the files on a developer machine, or in some [CI] environment,
create a tarball, and store this artifact in a safe location: if one loses this
file, it may be impossible to ever recreate an exact copy of the original
release. This could e.g. be caused by later versions of the build tools to
generate slightly different results for the same input, or these tools using
'external' values (including time, randomness,...) during generation.

## First Attempt

If the content of these release files is so precious, it makes sense to keep
them alongside something which is at least as valuable: the source repository of
the codebase, which contains the all code and its history. Given this, one can
come up with a scheme like the following:

<style scoped> @import url("{{ '/assets/css/gitgraph-1.8.3.css' | absolute_url }}"); </style>
<script src="{{ '/assets/js/gitgraph-1.8.3.min.js' | absolute_url }}"></script>

<canvas id='gitGraph1'></canvas>
<script>
var master = new GitGraph({
  elementId: 'gitGraph1',
  template: 'metro',
  orientation: 'vertical',
  author: 'Nicolas T.',
  mode: 'extended',
}).branch('master');

master.commit('Initialize repository');
master.commit('Implement crazy feature');

master.commit('Set version number to 1.0.0');
master.commit({
  message: 'Import generated files into repository',
  tag: 'package-1.0.0',
  sha1: 'ec4e927',
  dotColor: '#f1c109',
});

master.commit({
  message: 'Revert "Import generated files into repository"',
  sha1: '12c6685',
});

master.commit('Set version number to 1.0.1-pre');
master.commit('Fix bug in crazy feature');
</script>

Whilst this repository now contains a tag to a released tree which contains all
generated files, this has a major drawback: it also introduces a subsequent
commit (`12c6685`) which explicitly removes all these generated files again,
immediately following the commit in which they were added. Furthermore, this
requires one more commit to bump the version number. This clutters the
repository history.


## Second Attempt

To overcome the sequence of `Import generated files` and subsequent revert
commits, we can try an alternative approach, stashing the imports away in
a branch:

<canvas id='gitGraph2'></canvas>
<script>
var master = new GitGraph({
  elementId: 'gitGraph2',
  template: 'metro',
  orientation: 'vertical',
  author: 'Nicolas T.',
  mode: 'extended',
}).branch('master');

master.commit('Initialize repository');
master.commit('Implement crazy feature');

var release100 = master.branch('release-1.0.0');
release100.commit('Set version number to 1.0.0');
release100.commit({
  message: 'Import generated files into repository',
  tag: 'package-1.0.0',
  dotColor: '#f1c109',
});

master.commit('Set version number to 1.0.1-pre');
master.commit('Fix bug in crazy feature');
</script>

Whilst this approach doesn't require any revert of `Import generated files`
commits, it has another drawback: the relation between tags and branches is
lost. As an example, running a command like `git describe --tags` on the
`master` branch will never result in any release tags to be part of the output.


## Final Approach

Fixing the limitations of the previous approach is trivial: we simply need to
reinstate a connection between the release tag, and the development branch
(`master` in this example). How does one create a link between two branches? By
merging, of course! Here's how this works:

<canvas id='gitGraph3'></canvas>
<script>
var graph = new GitGraph({
  elementId: 'gitGraph3',
  template: 'metro',
  orientation: 'vertical',
  author: 'Nicolas T.',
  mode: 'extended',
});

var master = graph.branch('master');
master.commit('Initialize repository');
master.commit({
  message: 'Implement crazy feature',
  sha1: '43d6bf6',
});

var release100 = master.branch('release-1.0.0');
release100.commit('Set version number to 1.0.0');
release100.commit({
  message: 'Import generated files into repository',
  tag: 'package-1.0.0',
  dotColor: '#f1c109',
});

release100.merge(master, {
  message: 'Merge tag \'package-1.0.0\' into master',
  dotColor: '#a42315',
  sha1: '49e527e',
});

master.commit('Fix bug in crazy feature');
</script>

As-is, this wouldn't yield the desired result: the merge-commit in `49e527e`
would result in a tree which contains the generated files (in this specific
case the tree at `49e527e` would be equal to the `package-1.0.0` tree,
actually), which is clearly *not* what we aimed for. Instead, we should run
`git merge --no-commit` when merging `package-1.0.0` into `master`, undo all
the changes made in the `release-1.0.0` branch (i.e. remove the generated
files and reset the version number), only then to `git commit` the resulting
merge. Also note the *tag* (`package-1.0.0`) gets merged into `master`, not the
`release-1.0.0` branch (which makes only a difference when the tag is annotated,
of course).

Aside: you may have noticed the schema above no longer contains a `Set version
number to 1.0.1-pre` commit: this is no longer required, because one may opt to
bump the version number as part of the merge commit (`49e527e`). Some may
object against this approach and still keep a separate commit to increase the
value. Others may use some specific number for `master` versions. All of these
have pros and cons, pick one and be consistent.

Whilst the approach described above may seem laborious, note it's fairly easy
to automate the workflow. Also, when using Autotools, it's now possible to
release the output of `git archive` of a release tag, instead of relying on
`make dist`. Validating whether `make distcheck` passes, and asserting the
content of a resulting distribution package resembles an archive generated by
Git, e.g. as part of a CI pipeline, is of course good practice!

Finally, this approach interacts nicely with the [GitWaterFlow] branching model
we presented at [RELENG'16], but more about that later!
